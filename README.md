# Skinhaven

## A Collective place of discussion and trading for gaming skins

### On this site you can:

1. Create a user for the hub
2. Discuss about gaming skins with other enthusiasts
3. Browse available skins
4. Buy skins from others, transfering the ownership to you
5. Sell your skins to others in a safe and secure way


The trading of skins is implemented on a 3rd party service provider and the site 
does not handle any payments or see payment details. The data is sent and verified 
to a collective skin and NFT database handler before any transaction is finished, 
to guarantee the safe transfer of ownership.
